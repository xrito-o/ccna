## **Types of Networks**

1. **Local Area Network (LAN)** – Covers a small geographic area, such as an office, school, or home.
2. **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)** – Covers a larger area than LAN, such as a city or metropolitan region.
3. **Wide Area Network (WAN)** – Covers very large geographic areas, often connecting multiple LANs across countries or continents (e.g., the Internet).
4. **Campus Area Network (CAN)** – Connects multiple LANs within a limited geographic area such as a university campus or corporate complex.
5. **Personal Area Network (PAN)** – A small network centered around a single person, typically using wireless technologies such as Bluetooth.

## **Requirements for Network Configuration**

1. **Network Devices** – PCs, servers, printers, mobile devices, etc.
2. **Network Operating System** – Manages network resources and communication (e.g., Windows Server, Linux).
3. **Network Interface Card (NIC)** – Hardware enabling devices to connect to the network.
4. **Device Drivers** – Software that allows the operating system to communicate with hardware.
5. **Communication Media** – Cables (Ethernet, fiber optic) or wireless connections (Wi‑Fi, Bluetooth).
6. **Protocols** – Rules and standards for communication (e.g., TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP).
