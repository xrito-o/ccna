## **Non‑Modular Router**

![alt text](<../../../../assets/Non‑Modular Router.png>)

A **Non‑Modular Router** is a **low-end router** with **fixed interfaces or cards** that cannot be upgraded or expanded with additional ports later. These routers are typically used in environments where network requirements are minimal and unlikely to change.

### **Characteristics**

1. **Fixed Interfaces** – The number and type of ports (Ethernet, Serial, etc.) are pre-installed and cannot be modified.
2. **Cost-Effective** – Generally less expensive than modular routers.
3. **Compact Design** – Smaller in size, suitable for limited space environments.
4. **Target Usage** – Commonly used by **home users** and **small businesses** to connect to an Internet Service Provider (ISP).
5. **Limited Scalability** – Not suitable for large networks or networks expecting future growth.
