## **Chassis Router**

![alt text](<../../../../assets/Chassis Router.png>)

A **Chassis Router** is a high-performance, modular networking device designed for large-scale networks. It is built around a **chassis frame**, which serves as the housing for multiple modular components and provides both **power** and a **high-speed backplane** for data transfer.

### **Characteristics**

1. **Chassis Frame** – Acts as the main structure for mounting router modules, line cards, and power supplies.
2. **High-Speed Backplane** – Provides fast internal data communication between modules and components.
3. **Power Supply Integration** – Houses redundant power supplies for reliability and continuous operation.
4. **Environmental Protection** – Protects internal components from **dust**, **moisture**, and **tampering**.
5. **Scalability** – Supports the addition of multiple interface cards, processors, and other modules to meet growing network demands.
6. **Use Cases** – Commonly used in **data centers**, **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)**, and **large enterprise networks** where high throughput and reliability are essential.
